But when these emotions start to create a hurdle for you that won&#8217;t let you go about living your daily life, that&#8217;s where the real issue is. Such emotional stress should be managed so that quality of life can be improved. There are hundreds of ways you can employ to manage these emotional states and one such way is <a href=\"https:\/\/sydneychiropractorcbd.com.au\/\">chiropractic care<\/a>.\u00a0<\/p><h2><strong>WHAT IS EMOTIONAL STRESS ?<\/strong><\/h2><p><a href=\"https:\/\/my.clevelandclinic.org\/health\/articles\/6406-emotional-stress-warning-signs-management-when-to-get-help#:~:text=What%20is%20emotional%20stress%3F,are%20all%20part%20of%20life.\">Stress<\/a> is a very normal reaction to anything or any event that is worrisome. If the emotion underlying your feelings interferes with your ability to live life and overwhelms you into being unable to do the most basic day to day tasks, this is an unhealthy form of stress called emotional stress. This translates to a psychological strain on your mind and body which can affect your life very negatively.<\/p><h3><strong>SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS<\/strong><\/h3><p>Symptoms of emotional stress can be varied. Some of the many symptoms you might encounter are:<\/p><ul><li>General body aches; like shoulder pain, <a href=\"https:\/\/sydneychiropractorcbd.com.au\/back-pain-treatment-sydney-cbd\/\">back pain<\/a>.<\/li><li>Increased heart rate.<\/li><li>The heaviness of chest or chest pain.<\/li><li>Unconscious teeth grinding and jaw clenching.<\/li><li>Headache<\/li><li>Dizziness<\/li><li>Shortness of breath<\/li><li>Changes in appetite<\/li><li>Gut problems<\/li><li>Decline in reproductive health.<\/li><\/ul><p>There are some symptoms that a person going through emotional stress exhibits. These are:<\/p><ul><li>Feeling overwhelmed<\/li><li>Being on edge<\/li><li>Trouble in decision making<\/li><li>Resorting to substance abuse for support.<\/li><li>Trouble concentrating on daily tasks.<\/li><\/ul><h2><strong>HOW TO MANAGE EMOTIONAL STRESS:<\/strong><\/h2><p>There are multiple techniques to relieve the symptoms of emotional stress. Some of the methods you can incorporate into your life to help yourself are below:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Start reading a book <\/strong>and take out some time for yourself. Give yourself a break from reality.<\/li><li><strong>Start doing calming exercises <\/strong>even for 15 minutes to harmonise your mind and body, and stabilise your emotional state.<\/li><li><strong>Practice mindfulness <\/strong>and focus your attention on things that make you calm and keep you grounded.<\/li><li><strong>Distract yourself from the emotional aspect of events<\/strong>. When you find yourself feeling anxious or upset over something that\u2019s already happened or in anticipation of something that\u2019s about to happen, divert your attention to something that is fun, so that only feelings of pleasure occupy your mind.<\/li><li><strong>Try meditation, <\/strong>which enhances mind-body connection and brings forth a general sense of calm.<\/li><li><strong>Start journalling. <\/strong>It will help you understand your thoughts and feelings better, plan for the future, while encouraging you to slow down and pay attention to the details of your life and surroundings.<\/li><li><strong>Get proper sleep. <\/strong>Stress can make you feel exhausted. Sleep it off and try to wakeup with a fresh mind and perspective.<\/li><li><strong>Start being in control<\/strong> as only you can do it. Stop giving way to emotions that cause havoc in your life. Be more in control, more focused and determined to take charge of your emotional well-being.<\/li><\/ul><h2><strong>WHEN TO GET PROFESSIONAL HELP?\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2><p>If you have tried some of the self-help remedies, and still feel stuck in a vicious circle that you can\u2019t seem to get out of, you might want to turn to help outside of yourself.<\/p><p>One of the modalities that is becoming increasingly popular among people to manage stress &#8211; whether emotional or physical &#8211; is chiropractic.<\/p><p>A person who experiences emotional stress tends to manifest symptoms of that stress physically. Some of these physical manifestations are invisible (having no external symptoms, but can sometimes be felt to varying degrees by the person experiencing them) or very visible, even to others.<\/p><p>Chiropractic is a form of alternative medicine for management of pain, injury and other alignment issues involving primarily the spine, as well as joints, muscles and bones. It involves realigning the neuro-musculoskeletal system of a person to restore wellbeing and function.<\/p><p>Think about what happens to a person\u2019s emotional state under intense stress due to imminent danger. Muscles tighten, the body becomes stiff and rigid as it enters \u2018fight or flight\u2019 mode. The mind is agitated with a million stimuli and thoughts coming at it requiring split-second decision making, fists and jaw may be clenched, profuse sweating is likely occurring, A lot of stress is placed on the spinal cord, where the mind-body connection is centred. The stress on the spine is immediately felt in such cases because of the extraordinarily enormous amount of communication being transmitted between the brain and the body.<\/p><p>The body can stay in this emotionally-charged state even after the traumatic event has passed, because \u201cpain has a good memory\u201d. Chronic depression, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and sporadic anxiety attacks are extreme examples of this.<\/p><p>Pain is physically and psychologically debilitating in a way that few other conditions are.<\/p><h2><strong>SO HOW CAN CHIROPRACTIC CARE HELP WITH EMOTIONAL STRESS?<\/strong><\/h2><p>With chiropractic therapy, adjustments are made to the body to relieve stress points and pain, while helping a person feel more aligned and rejuvenated. Along with dietary\/lifestyle changes, and the self-help techniques previously talked about, chiropractic adjustments will help alleviate the physical stresses on your body brought on by emotional and other stresses, and in doing so, help your nervous system better perform its job of bringing about homeostasis, and managing your emotional balance.<\/p><p>Don\u2019t ignore the warning signs your mind and body give you to call for help for emotional stress.
