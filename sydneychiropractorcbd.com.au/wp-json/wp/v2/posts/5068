Most cases of head asymmetry occur in babies born with a normal shaped head, and the head asymmetry develops after birth, usually becoming apparent to the parents or to a health care professional between four and eight weeks of age. The head asymmetry usually affects one side of the occipital bone or the back of the head.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The issue of head asymmetry has become more common as a result of the baby on the back program to reduce the incidence of SIDS. The head asymmetry is caused by constant pressure on one part of the back of the head, and this tells us that the baby is not able to turn their head properly to both sides, resulting in positional preference. Babies that develop head asymmetry have been found to have a positional preference and to also have restricted neck function. Many babies that go on to develop head asymmetry have associated torticollis, and may have a sternocleidomastoid muscle\u00a0tumour\u00a0along with contraction of this muscle.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> To avoid this you can seek help from a chiropractor for baby flat head syndrome at <a href=\"https:\/\/sydneychiropractorcbd.com.au\/\">Clinic 27<\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\u00a0Here&#8217;s all you need to know about this condition.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">The Cause of Plagiocephaly or Head Asymmetry<\/span><\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The link between positional preference and plagiocephaly was explored by Miller and Clarion. They found that 84% of their 174 patients born with normal head shape and subsequently developed occipital plagiocephaly, had associated torticollis. The development of asymmetric head, affecting the back of the head (occiput) was shown to be associated with significant upper cervical spine issues in most patients. This relationship had been earlier demonstrated by Slate and colleagues who evaluated 30 infants for<a href=\"https:\/\/www.rch.org.au\/kidsinfo\/fact_sheets\/Plagiocephaly_misshapen_head\/\"> congenital muscular<\/a> torticollis, and found that 26 of these patients had occipital plagiocephaly, 13 of whom exhibited rotary subluxation of C1 of C2 with\u00a0computerised\u00a0tomographic (CT) scanning.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">This research indicates that at least half of the patients with head asymmetry affecting the back of the head, have clinically significant upper cervical spine subluxation.

The technical term for this is afforestation. We get our sensory input from our eyes, ears, taste, touch and proprioception. Proprioception is all the information and messages going to the brain from the joints, muscles and ligaments. Proprioception provides a massive and continuous barrage of messages into the brain via the spinal cord. 90% of the total sensory input to the brain comes from the spine and associated structures, especially the upper cervical spine which has the greatest density of nerve receptors in the spine.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Sensory input stimulates the cells of the brain to form connections, or pathways, replicate and help develop the architecture of the brain. Sensory input is so important that without sufficient sensory input, our brain starts to make it up and we start to hallucinate. But an even more serious effect is that abnormal sensory input can result in failure of the brain to develop correctly, causing in extreme cases, mental retardation.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Cervical spine dysfunction will produce altered neurological function. This means that cervical spine dysfunction will alter sensory input, and the resultant change in neurological function will affect brain development. Our job as Chiropractors is to detect joint dysfunction along with the effect this is having on the nervous system and the sensory input. By correcting the joint dysfunction and permitting normal sensory input, optimal brain development will be possible.\u00a0Also\u00a0by restoring normal cervical spine function, the baby will no longer have a positional preference resulting in improvement of the baby\u2019s head shape. Clinically, the best results regarding improved head shape and normal proprioception are obtained with treatment and correction of any abnormal cervical spine function prior to six months of age.

This is best achieved by Chiropractors. Once normal cervical spine function has been restored, positional management where the baby\u2019s head is turned to the\u00a0non flat\u00a0side while asleep, can then be effective. If the cervical spine issue is not resolved, then positional management is less effective. If there is involvement of the neck muscle (such as a sternocleidomastoid\u00a0tumour), then stretching exercises will need to be part of the program of care. The stretching exercises will be provided by your <a href=\"https:\/\/sydneychiropractorcbd.com.au\/about-clinic27\/\">Chiropractor<\/a>. It is important to resolve any issue regarding muscle contracture as early as possible to\u00a0minimise\u00a0the possibility of later need for surgical correction of the muscle tissue.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Key Takeaways<\/h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">As a general rule, resolution of the head asymmetry will require a time period equal to the infant\u2019s age, when normal cervical spine function has been restored.
