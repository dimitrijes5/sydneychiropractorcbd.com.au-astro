Many people worldwide are afflicted with debilitating back pain, in many cases this can prevent them engaging in day to day activities. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sydneychiropractorcbd.com.au\/main-reasons-for-lower-back-pain\/\">Back pain can arise from many causes<\/a><\/span>; it could be from accidents or injuries, toxins or diet or even in some cases thoughts or stress.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>As back pain can also affect the body&#8217;s ability to function, it&#8217;s imperative that the condition be treated as quickly as possible and with much care. Only an expert can hone in on the necessary measures required to alleviate such injuries efficiently. Clinic 27 is here to help! Our team of <a href=\"https:\/\/sydneychiropractorcbd.com.au\/\">Sydney CBD chiropractors<\/a>, use the most up-to-date methods to help patients.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>Among all ailments, back pain is one of the more common complaints among people worldwide. Sufferers can be either old or young, which makes it one of the more universal,\u00a0and most treated, conditions. However, age increases one&#8217;s chances of injuring their back and inflicting pain on that particular area of the body.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>Want to find out more about our <a href=\"https:\/\/sydneychiropractorcbd.com.au\/back-pain-treatment-sydney-cbd\/\">back pain treatment<\/a>, services and rates? Give the team at Clinic 27 a call today to see if we may also be able to help you.<\/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"h-abc-for-carpal-tunnel-syndrome\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">ABC Treatment for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome<\/h2>\n\n<p>Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is a common ailment for many people; the prevalence in women is up to three times more likely. Females generally have a smaller carpal tunnel, a narrow passageway in the wrist, which opens into the hand. This tunnel has the bones within the wrist beneath it and a special nerve known as the median nerve runs through this area. When there is pressure on the large median nerve this can cause irritation, numbness and sometimes pain which is commonly associated with the condition.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>The non-surgical treatments include: lots of rest for the affected hand, chiropractic treatments &amp; physiotherapy, wearing a splint on the wrist and hand at night, diuretic medications to reduce fluid retention within the body, and corticosteroid injections to reduce the swelling.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>It is usually advisable to seek out non-surgical treatments for such things as <a href=\"https:\/\/sydneychiropractorcbd.com.au\/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-treatment-sydney-cbd\/\">Carpal Tunnel Syndrome<\/a>, as surgery is best left as a last resort. The compression of the nerve does not always happen at the wrist, as nerve roots are located at the spinal cord near the lower part of the neck. Treatment of the spinal cord, can, therefore, sometimes alleviate the condition. Less invasive treatments like chiropractic joint manipulation or mobilisation, stretching, and massage can be effective. In some instances, hand and wrist pain are not Carpal Tunnel\u00a0Syndrome at all, but caused by something else, and may respond to spinal, tendon and joint therapy treatments.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"h-abc-for-vertigo\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">ABC Treatment for Vertigo<\/h2>\n\n<p>Vertigo can affect many people for a variety of different reasons. Whether the condition is chronic or stems from the onset of migraine headaches, vertigo is an unpleasant sensation that makes the most basic of daily tasks difficult to bear.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>So what causes vertigo, exactly? In many cases vertigo can be caused by an issue with the inner ear. If the function in this area is not working as the body expects it can lead to imbalance that may inhibit standing, sitting or functioning comfortably in an upright motion. Some of the most common causes of vertigo are:\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Meniere&#8217;s disease &#8211; A build-up of fluid and changing pressure in the inner ear leads to this disorder\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 BPPV \u2013 Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo is caused by the build-up of small calcium particles in the inner ear canal\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Vestibular neuritis \u2013 An inner ear disorder usually caused by an infection\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Stroke\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Brain tumour\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Neck injury\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Back injury\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Migraines\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Certain medications<\/p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the causes of vertigo are many, which makes vertigo treatment all that much trickier. Trained Chiropractors who treat vertigo, can be found in our Sydney city clinic. A consultation with our team is recommended for this disorder so that we may understand the cause and treat it accordingly.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>Vertigo can be an uncomfortable feeling that gives off the sensation of a lack of balance. As such, many sufferers will have a difficult time sitting or standing upright. The most common symptoms are:\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Nausea\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Tilting\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Lack of balance\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Sweating\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Headaches or migraines\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Jerking eye movements\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Hearing Loss<\/p>\n\n<p>\u00a0To best target the symptoms and the vertigo itself, rehabilitation is a necessary vertigo treatment. A chiropractor can hone in on the actual cause of the vertigo in order to tackle the pressure points that might be exacerbating the issue. Unlike medications and other invasive treatments, a chiropractor can help you find a solution purely by understanding the overall functioning of your body.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>As such, our chiropractors at Clinic 27 may have the chiropractor ABC vertigo solution for you. We can assess your condition and target the pressure points that are causing your vertigo.

In fact, the chiropractic team at Clinic 27 has helped many vertigo sufferers.

Essentially it details a curvature of the spine, scoliosis can cause pain and discomfort to those who are afflicted with the condition.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, this often makes daily life a struggle due to the pain and difficulties scoliosis sufferers face when they walk, sit or partake in any activities.

We can apply non-invasive methods like the ABC\u00a0method to provide relief of the pains and symptoms associated to the condition.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>Scoliosis consists of a curvature of the spine, caused by many different factors. The different types of scoliosis are:\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Congenital scoliosis \u2013 This is caused by a bone abnormality at birth.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Neuromuscular scoliosis \u2013 Resulting from paralysis, this type of scoliosis is specifically cause by abnormal muscles or nerves.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Degenerative scoliosis \u2013 This type is due to degenerative bone disease, extreme surgery or severe back trauma.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Idiopathic scoliosis \u2013 This is considered the most common type of scoliosis and no clear identifiable cause has been found. Scoliosis is detected through X-Ray screenings and two of the most common treatments for the condition consist of the use of braces and invasive surgery.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Using the Advanced Bio structural Correction (ABC) Method, a <a href=\"https:\/\/sydneychiropractorcbd.com.au\/scoliosis-treatment-sydney-cbd\/\">Scoliosis chiropractor<\/a> will hone in on the specific places in the spine where the condition is at its worst.

Many patients have consulted our team of Chiropractors when other treatments have been of limited or no effect and found our treatments to look at the body as a whole rather than a specific area which may have a better outcome for their case.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>Sciatica can affect many people from all walks of life, it is often caused by a spinal disc herniation and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sydneychiropractorcbd.com.au\/disc-pain\/\">other disc-related issues<\/a><\/span>. This herniation is usually the cause of age-related degeneration due to injuries incurred. With time, sciatica can worsen and have negative consequences on a person&#8217;s quality of life.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>Sciatic pain can make it difficult to sleep and walk; sciatica is a debilitating condition that requires extra attention and care when treating it. The pain is usually described as a sharp shooting type, stemming from below the knee all the way down to the foot. This level of inflammation can persist for years and worsen if the area is not treated with regular therapy and care.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>An experienced sciatica chiropractor can assess such a medical condition, understanding the reasons for its initial onset and the ways to prevent aggravating it further. Our team of Chiropractors at Clinic 27 are trained to diagnose and make recommendations specific to these conditions.\u00a0Our chiropractors will look at your spine, to see the issues and the injuries it is unable to correct on its own.

The muscles, bones and nerves involved in this support can often get inflamed and cause severe pain to the individual.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>Although this pain can be caused by obvious injury, simple motions such as bad posture and overuse can also exacerbate the pain. This directly affects the afflicted individual in their daily lives making work, play or sleep an arduous activity that causes strain. In order to alleviate the symptoms of neck pain, and the injury itself, a trained neck pain chiropractor is required to assess and treat the condition.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>A professional can best understand the injury in order to put forth a plan of action that will ensure rehabilitation and a realignment of the area. The trained Chiropractors at Clinic 27 have treated many cases of neck pain, which have allowed us to develop an efficient and successful strategy for tackling the condition.

The noise when you receive an adjustment is simply gas within your joint being released. A Chiropractic treatment does not aim to release the gas, it is merely a side effect of little to no clinical consequence. Some adjustments don&#8217;t make any noise at all.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<h3 id=\"h-are-adjustments-safe\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are adjustments safe?<\/h3>\n\n<p>While there are always risks associated with any procedure, we minimise the risk through our thorough history, examination and testing as well as using specific gentle techniques.
