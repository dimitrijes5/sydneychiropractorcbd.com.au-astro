Spinal decompression is a modern, non-invasive therapy designed to relieve pressure on the spinal discs and nerves. This gentle treatment is an excellent alternative to surgery for many patients suffering from chronic back pain.

### The Decompression Process

During a session, you will lie on a specialized table. The table is computer-controlled to create a gentle stretching force on the spine. This process creates negative pressure within the discs, which can help retract bulging or herniated discs and promote the flow of healing nutrients into the disc.

### Who Can Benefit?

This therapy is ideal for individuals with:
- Herniated or bulging discs
- Sciatica
- Degenerative disc disease
- Pinched nerves
- Facet syndrome

A full course of treatment is typically recommended for the best results. Our team will evaluate your condition to determine if spinal decompression is right for you.
