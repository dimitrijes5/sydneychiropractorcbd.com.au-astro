Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that has been practiced for thousands of years. It involves the insertion of very thin needles into specific points on the body to stimulate energy flow (Qi) and promote natural healing.

### How It Works

The practice is based on the theory that energy flows through pathways in the body called meridians. When this flow is disrupted, it can lead to pain and illness. By stimulating specific points along these meridians, acupuncture can restore balance and improve health.

### Conditions Treated

Acupuncture is effective for a wide range of conditions, including:
- Chronic back pain
- Neck pain
- Headaches and migraines
- Arthritis
- Insomnia
- Stress and anxiety

Our skilled practitioners will conduct a thorough assessment to create a personalized treatment plan tailored to your needs.
